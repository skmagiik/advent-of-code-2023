# Advent of Code 2023

## Objective

My personal objective for the Advent of Code for 2023 is to help introduce myself to rust and to compare my solutions with others' as I learn the language and syntax.
Later on I will revisit these problems and re-solve with newly learned tools. I am already aware that my current solutions will not be optimal nor "rust-like."

## Feedback

If you have any feedback for my code please feel free to reach out and contact me via github or by filing a ticket on my repo.
